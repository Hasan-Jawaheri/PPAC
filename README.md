The Portable Personal Air Conditioner
This project is a system to run a hexacopter that tracks a human head and follows it. The idea is to make the hexacopter hold an umbrella-like object to provide shelter from the sun, along with the air it blows while providing thrust to fly. The hexacopter should balance itself and keep following the owner to keep him cool in the heat of QATAR (Jihannam heat).

Requirements:
- Django framework
- openCV 2.4
- Arduino IDE
- Python modules: requests, netifaces, serial
